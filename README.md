# CafeFinder
This is a practical program for ios

This practical is coded by object-c

click CafeFinder.xcworkspace to run the code

using AFNetWorking, ocmock, rmmapper third party framework

Assumption: 
    I am not sure the distance come from the api is correct or not because i calculate the distance between two points by latitude and longitude and the result is not close to the data i get from the website. 

    The phone call function may using real machine test because of no handler with virtual test.

  I still stuck on unit test and ui test part because I have never used it before. so I am still learning how to write it and will upload in 3 days later. 
  
  Thank you for your time to check my code.
